## Roles I'm searching for...

### Web Developer

The secondary role I am looking for is a web developer. This is what I have the most experience in and believe I have a good understanding of the full stack. From databases and backends to presenting things on a webpage, I can do it.

## Projects

### Sirme: A Simon Game (React Project in progress)

Sirme will be my first React project created in React. It is a Simon game with a couple stylistic twists.

### GridSquid (2022)

GridSquid is an educational single-page application coded in JavaScript and Python (Django) that lets users make custom grids of images with associated sounds and captions.

### Oopsie (2021)

Oopsie is a web-based anti-fertility application that celebrates the wonderful, life-altering event of not getting pregnant. It was built with Python, Flask, and JavaScript.

### Space Pool

Today I am the cofounder of [Space Pool](http://pool.space), a Chia farming (mining) pool with over 30K members. The Space Pool Discord is the go-to community for any talk about the Chia cryptocurrency with 35K+ members. I am a full stack web developer using a variety of languages and tools like **React**, **Node.js**, **typescript**, and **ASP.NET**. I also created a crypto price **discord bot written in Python**.

Space Pool is the largest Chia pool using the official pooling protocol, and the second largest overall.

## My Skills Include...

### React

I'm comfortable with the **Solidity** language and continue to improve my skills. I've deployed sample contracts on the Kovan Ethereum testnet. [You can find the code here](https://github.com/CalebCurry/initial-solidity) and links to the smart contracts in the `readme.md`. This code includes multiple projects. One will use a [**Chainlink Oracle**](https://github.com/CalebCurry/initial-solidity/blob/main/docs.chain.link/samples/Tutorials/PriceChecker.sol) to get the current Ethereum price, another is a [lottery system](https://github.com/CalebCurry/initial-solidity/blob/main/projects/lottery.sol) that gives multiple contributors the chance to win some Eth!

I have also created ERC20 tokens with OpenZeppelin.

### JavaScript

Starting with the basics, I have bought and sold NFTs on OpenSea.io and am familiar with **metamask** and the various networks (Ethereum, Polygon, Solana). I am currently learning the [HashLips art engine](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine) used to generate NFT collections and working on my own NFTs. Coming soon!

One interest of mine is NFTs with utility. For example, I own multiple domains that are NFTs. This allows me to fully own the domain and host decentralized websites on **IPFS**. I believe much more in life could be tokenized and decentralized.

### Web Development

I have experience in most major backend languages and frameworks including **Node.js**, **ASP.NET**, **Django**, and **Flask**. For frontend, I know **React**, **Typescript**, and the essentials of **CSS**.

I have a good understanding of Databases (**SQL** and **NoSQL**) and I'm comfortable building an **API** using **JWT authorization**. I can create login systems in **React** and deploy everything to production on **AWS**.

I am able to build software in a team environment with **GitHub**, branches, and pull requests. This includes open source software such as [this portfolio website](https://github.com/CalebCurry/site) built with **Jeckyll** and hosted on **GitHub Pages**. Additionally, I have a good understanding of **Markdown** and technical documentation engines such as **Docusaurus** and **GitBook**. You can find an example of a [documentation website](https://wiki.pool.space/) I built. Here is the [open source code](https://github.com/space-pool/wiki).
