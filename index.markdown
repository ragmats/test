## Roles I'm searching for...

### Web Developer

The primary role I am looking for is a web developer. This is what I have the most experience in and believe I have a good understanding of the full stack. From databases and backends to presenting things on a webpage, I can do it.

## Projects

### Sirme: A Simon Game (React Project in progress)

Sirme will be my first React project created in React. It is a Simon game with a couple stylistic twists.
